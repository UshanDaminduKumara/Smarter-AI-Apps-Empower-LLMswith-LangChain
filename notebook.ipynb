    "`Chains` are one of the most powerful features in LangChain, allowing you to combine multiple components into cohesive workflows. This section presents two different methodologies for implementing chains - the traditional `SequentialChain` approach and the newer LangChain Expression Language (`LCEL`).\n",

    "**Why Chains Matter:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Chains solve a fundamental problem with LLMs. Chains are primarily designed to handle a single prompt and generate a single response. However, most real-world applications require multi-step reasoning, accessing different tools, or breaking complex tasks into manageable pieces. Chains allow you to orchestrate these complex workflows.\n",

    "\n",
    "Traditional chains (`LLMChain`, `SequentialChain`) were LangChain's first implementation, offering a structured but somewhat rigid approach. LCEL (using the pipe operator `|`) represents a more flexible, functional approach that's easier to compose and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** While both approaches are presented here for educational purposes, **LCEL is the recommended pattern for new development.** The SequentialChain approach continues to be supported for backward compatibility, but the LangChain community has largely transitioned to the LCEL pattern for its superior flexibility and expressiveness.\n"
